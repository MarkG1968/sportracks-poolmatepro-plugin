#summary Getting started with this Plug In.

= Introduction =

This plug imports poolmate pro data into SportTracks 3.0.

== Swimming Data ==

It will import each session into its own activity, and each set recorded by the PoolMatePro into a new lap. Fields that currently don't have a direct mapping are imported into the notes fields of the activity or the  lap (this will probably be enhanced in later versions to use custom fields.)

SwimmingSessionMapping section includes details of the mappings from the PoolMate Pro data to SportTracks model.

== Warning ==

Although the plug in has been used by a few users, it should be considered to be of 'beta' quality, so please bear that in mind if you decide to use it, and *please backup your training log*.

= Details =

There are certain limitation:
  * It only has English resouces and it will import to an activity called swimming.
  * It assumes that the Pool Mate Pro is set to the local time of the PC that is running SportTracks. This needs to be tested further with different time zones.
  * Swimming sessions don't necessarily fit so well with the SportTracks activity model.
  * It requires that the Pool Mate Link software is installed on the PC. Current the software imports the CSV files generated by the Pool Mate Link software, rather than communicating with the Pool Mate Pro via its USB connection (maybe one day!)

= Installation =

The plug in is packaged into the SportTracks plugin format an is available from the downloads section of this site. 

A ManualInstallation can also be performed.

= Instructions =

Some brief instructions on how to use the PlugIn to import sessions from the PoolMatePro are in the [Instructions] page.

= Development Details =

It is developed in C#/.NET 2.0 using the Sharp Develop IDE (Version 4.1) on WIndows 7. The solution should build using MSBuild.

== Building ==

The projects have been developed using SharpDevelop and have also been built using MSBuild using version 2.0 of the .NET Framework.

== Packaging as a PlugIn ==

There is an MSBuild file in the Package subdirectory of the project, which contains a package target to build the plug in file.
