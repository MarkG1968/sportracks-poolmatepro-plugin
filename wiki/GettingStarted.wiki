#summary Getting started with this Plug In.

= Introduction =

This plug imports poolmate pro data into SportTracks 3.0. It is currently of 'beta', maybe even 'alpha' quality, so please bear that in mind if you decide to use it, and please backup your training log.

= Details =

It is developed in C#/.NET 2.0 using the Sharp Develop IDE (Version 4.1) on WIndows 7. The solution should build using MSBuild.

There are certain limitation:
  * It only has English resouces and it will import to an activity called swimming.
  * It assumes that the Pool Mate Pro is set to the local time of the PC that is running SportTracks. This needs to be tested further with different time zones.
  * Swimming sessions don't necessarily fit so well with the SportTracks activity model.
  * It requires that the Pool Mate Link software is installed on the PC. Current the software imports the CSV files generated by the Pool Mate Link software, rather than communicating with the Pool Mate Pro via its USB connection (maybe one day!)

= Installation =

The plug in currently requires packaging into the SportTracks plugin format. A ManualInstallation can be performed instead.

= Building =

The projects have been developed using SharpDevelop and have also been built using MSBuild using version 2.0 of the .NET Framework.
