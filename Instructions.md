# Introduction #

This section has instruction on how to use and configure the plug in.


# Details #

  1. To use the plug start the PoolMate Link software and upload your sessions using it as per normal.
  1. In SportTracks click on the Import to start the import process.
  1. To add the PoolMate Pro to the list of devices, click on the '+' button and select the PoolMate Pro from the list of devices.
  1. The Configuration Dialog should be displayed. The key setting to check here is the PoolMate Directory. This is the directory where the PoolMate Link software uploads the session files to. On my installation this is at `C:\PoolMatePro` (with no obvious way in the PoolMate software to change it). Use the directory browser to choose another directory if this is not the case in your installation.
  1. If the chosen directory doesn't contain any PoolMate files, the dialog will show a warning.
  1. To import then press OK. You should then be presented with a list of sessions that you can import, using the standard SportTracks import dialog. From here you can preview and select the sessions you want to import.
